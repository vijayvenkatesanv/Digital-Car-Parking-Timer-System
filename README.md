# Digital-Car-Parking-Timer-System
The Digital Car Parking Timer System tracks the parking duration of vehicles using digital counters and logic circuits. When a vehicle occupies a slot, a counter starts, and a multiplexed 7-segment display shows the elapsed time. The system stops counting when the vehicle leaves, with a reset option for manual clearing.
